# Work-Day-Schedule

As a Web Developer, I'll be more than likely faced with a hectic schedule. This functioning work day planner with color coded hours indicating the past (grey), present (red), and 
future (green), will be able to help me organize my overall daily tasks. An up to date schedule, will give me the ability to focus on the details, finctionality, 
and presentation of my code and work. 

Implimenting my complex Javascript/Jquery, with my basic HTML and CSS is now able to give me an opportuntiy to utilitize a well functioning and clear "Work Day Scheduler".
